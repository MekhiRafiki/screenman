absolutely horrible but then the second two rounds were pretty dope homeboy from the Spurs and um M Steven castle Yeah
they they were crazy didn't you pick him he's nice enough to be in the dunk contest no I picked M he should have got
more points that dunk he did he definitely should went through the rim and then did the through the that was insane Sten Castle was nice enough for

us to stop referring to him as the guy from Boy from the Spurs he's he's all right yeah he's he's all right shout out

hey guess who I don't want to see an Allstar Sunday just say guess sweetie sweetie

who who he brought out after that wait who was after sweti invoke invogue now I

wasn't mad at invoke I love invoke I was not mad at invoke you know what the Bay Area got they got a lot more Legends

than than than the world gives them credit for True they' contributed way more to music than the rest of the world

would like to recognize that's a fact now when invo came out I absolutely

loved that I couldn't figure out if Dawn was there why cuz I don't know if Dawn was

there I don't know if the taller attractive woman that was all the way to the right was Dawn now that she's aged a

little bit or did they replace Dawn I know that was The Dawn invol I'm old enough to know there was a little beef

for a little minute so I don't know if Dawn was there she was she made it happen was that Dawn yeah oh then

awesome awesome you got all of them back in the same room I was happy about invoke I was happy about invol nice nice

[ __ ] if you could be happy about sweee I could be have oh no for sure for sure for sure they had to dress this one I'd

like involes music I know me too oo what the [ __ ] was that what the hell

is that that remember she held a long note in the beginning of the first Joy hold on yes yeah yeah yeah that was my

imitation to that did they had a dress back to you I can't do it now I can't do

it uh yeah they they looked great they looked great sh in Vogue who it was a lot of [ __ ] on that Sunday Allstar

Weekend the first time out of the game I do like the Inside the NBA tribute that

they did that that was fire but that was fire that was the best part of everything I saw I didn't want to see

them [ __ ] no more neither nah n you you got to do it right and that I just it was the first time out of the game

and that [ __ ] took like 15 minutes bro it was long but pause it um I think that

was the best part of everything that I saw from the whole weekend they went through Craig they went through Charles

they went through all these [ __ ] when they was young like that [ __ ] was fire all the people that we lost you know what I'm saying so I think that was dope

I think they went out cuz that's they last allar G the last allar so I think that was fly I just hate that the best

like you just said like the best part of the Allstar Weekend wasn't the allstar you right yeah that was the best thing I saw and it's like it it used to be a

thing like it used to be an actual good game I used to be excited to actually watch the players play and instead of

like making the players just play you know what I mean they do all these other tricks drafting players and what no no

to me raise the amount go ahead what happened it was so lopsided after a while where the West was just so stacked

they had to it took the excitement out the game you knew the West was gonna win so they tried to change it up with the

draft so now you mixing a player pool up where you're not getting everybody on the same Squad and it's like that's stupid like to me what you do is to me

you you make a a big enough cash reward cuz players make too much money to care about the All-Star game they got too

much at stake you trying to win a championship you're not worried about it but you put real money on it if every player W even a million dollars right if

every single player w a million dollar I think players will play a lot harder to win I'm talking about to win uh I agree

with that but then but then what happens is you're risking getting injured for a

exhibition game now we can't you know what I'm saying so they kind of don't want to play hard they just make too much money that

they really don't even give a [ __ ] I'm going keep it a that's or so it seems I just remember I said they need to do I

said many years ago that they need to do what baseball did and the winner of the allstar game gets home court advantage

during the finals that also make people play hard really unless you want to 10 bum teams ain't got no shot at the

finals anyway but like there's enough player like for the Knicks for example that's a good example y'all got two guys on there y'all have a legitimate shot at

the champ at going to the finals so so C and jayen gonna play hard you know what I mean LeBron is going to play hard if

he had played like I think I think it's a great idea that ain't a bad idea you got to incentivize it in some way shape

or form for them to even want to play it was barely any basketball played uh they showed us players aggravated frustrated

from all the TV production [ __ ] you got us taking 20 and 30 minute breaks and then you want us to go out here and and

we can't we don't cool off we've cooled off and then you risk an injury yeah you

know what I'm saying what what I did see that I think will help to change things

is Victor wiana he wanted to play who not only wanted to play was visibly

upset at other people not playing yep yes he's great enough and young enough

to make a difference in this what you think about him and uh Chris Paul doing that [ __ ] syst skills challenge that sh

was I lik it I did too I lik it that was funny I hated that sh that's some Chris Paul [ __ ] [ __ ] too you know that

Chris Paul Chris Paul said it was a Victor idea yes I would say that too if I it smell likeis Paul man come on man

like just do the that do the skills challenge the fans came to see a skills challenge not to watch you try to win by throwing shots pretending to throw shots

against the wall throw the skills challenge in the garbage agreed that [ __ ] was never that fly and give us a

one-onone match up with some of our best one-on-one players in the NBA never

happen I would love cuz players don't want to get cooked they want to get exactly they're not do that's it I'm they're never doing that but that's the

answer one on one is the I I say get rid of Slam Dunk contest at this point the [ __ ] is uninteresting no I think we've

seen all the dunks we can see I think next year it'll be better I don't why why because uh people like Zach LaVine

and them are talking about potentially coming back Jack LaVine is 78 years old man oh and I saw what johnar said

he said that a couple yo M MCL you inspiring me yeah I know I know I know that's inspiring not the NBA dropping

you as the face of the league for the next 10 years right m mclung is getting you inspired that's how that's how I

potentially get some of that back the dunk contest is done because dunks are done the excitement is not on the focus

of the dunk no more the league don't care about they don't care about dunks no more right it's it's not a highlight anymore they don't give a [ __ ] no I

think I think the dunk contest lost his luster when these [ __ ] start doing corny [ __ ] there's nothing left to do

n some of the bro that's not true you watch some these if you watch some of these these Street dunking [ __ ] they

kill it they be doing crazy [ __ ] dudes don't do that [ __ ] so it's some [ __ ] that you can find to do drop the drop

the drop the hoop two two feet what is I they're not going to do that I'm just saying like put it up two

feet [ __ ] that no that's a 11 feet maybe that might get some some interest but

and I heard them floating idea uh of the NBA versus the uh foreign players in the

NBA that they don't want that either I don't lead them internationally beat that will be wom

Jana Joker GRE freak Luka Shai and then be MB

well he he'll be injured he'll be injured that's the only game he does play Carl Anthony towns would be on that team a lot of jok bro leave that alone

yeah they don't want don't bark up that tree that's going to be a real awaking for for for the NBA test and and and and

listen you don't even have to do that every year do it do it uh every other year that would fix things we would want

to see that cuz Shai was another one that took the game really seriously he took it seriously yeah he took the game seriously he want the MVP that [ __ ]

want the MVP yeah he want he that [ __ ] put the ball in the bucket bro I don't give a [ __ ] in a he got moves that in

the elevator that [ __ ] get oh he a problem he probably going to win MVP the League this year I don't think he deserve it but he probably get I think I

still want yic to get it but the NBA just ain't black enough enough no more nah that's the that's the other elephant

in the room right it's not black enough you think it's definitely not black American enough yeah that's what I'm

that's what I'm saying Victor Yama don't count I want a [ __ ] without parents I want somebody I'm serious single mom

single struggle yeah From The Trenches but you can't do this is whoever's in Char whoever their Jesse Collins is

that's in charge of producing this you could tell is not like us you could tell that

you know what let me not say that cuz let me not just rush to to riseing background the NBA is an analytics

driven League now yes so you could see that they're applying that also to

content creation and they're leaning to that uh more so than curation I agree

and the other thing is it's not curated properly they're so International now bro like China all
